Goals:

1. Set the active image in the state of the Gallery component (use placeholder images)
2. Populate the Gallery Thumb component with 3 inactive images (use a loop)
3. On click of each gallery thumb, update the active image using a callback and state
4. Add styling and animation to make it beautiful
